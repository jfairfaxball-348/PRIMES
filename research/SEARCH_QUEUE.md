## SQ-001 — Baseline representation sweep

Stage: discovery

Status: **CANDIDATE TRIAGE COMPLETE — NO CANDIDATE CREATED; THREE REPLICATED OBSERVATIONS RETAINED; A0 WAS UNTOUCHED THROUGH SQ-001, LATER CONTAMINATED BY FAIL-003**

Frozen specification: `experiments/E001_REPRESENTATION_GRID.md`

Predeclared value ranges:

- discovery D0: `[0, 1_000_000)`;
- untouched holdout H0: `[1_000_000, 2_000_000)`;
- reserved adversarial A0: `[10_000_000, 11_000_000)`.

Run exact scans over:

- gap words of widths 2 through 6;
- finite differences through order 4;
- residue transitions for the frozen modulus family `6, 10, 12, 30, 60`;
- globally anchored block occupancies at widths `100, 1_000, 10_000, 100_000`;
- strict global record-gap neighbourhoods at gap radii `2, 4, 8`.

Goal: produce descriptive summaries and artifact checks only.

Promotion cap: 10 observations.

D0 result: deterministic discovery artifact SHA-256 `822431d664d5a35949abdf230a1b8abb41afa1f97511b7c129e5d18779f2e284`; four observations were frozen before holdout.

H0 result: deterministic holdout artifact SHA-256 `80c8c49f1845e941764b31471404a8e674fa794394687cb6502dbd2eca980254`. `OBS-001`, `OBS-002`, and `OBS-003` replicated under their frozen criteria. `OBS-004` was refuted by the empty anchored block `[1_671_800, 1_671_900)`. A0 remained untouched through SQ-001; it was later contaminated by generation during the discarded D1-04 E002 implementation (FAIL-003) without inspection.

Candidate-synthesis result: D1-02 considered `OBS-001` through `OBS-003` only and allocated no `CAND-###`. OBS-001 and OBS-002 remain exact replicated modal-rank facts but do not yet support a non-arbitrary scale/band quantifier. OBS-003 remains exact replicated finite-grid coverage but does not yet justify an all-moduli or infinite-occurrence extrapolation. OBS-004 remains REFUTED and excluded.

Next bounded action: D1-03 / SQ-002 cross-scale persistence preflight. Freeze a new E002 design and fresh disjoint ranges before execution, using the E001 definitions unchanged and excluding reserved A0. Do not generate new results, create a candidate, perform mechanism work, or run prior-art search in that preflight unit.

## SQ-002 — Cross-scale persistence

Stage: replication

Status: **D1-06 TRIAGE COMPLETE — NO CANDIDATE; OBS-002/003 PERSISTENT; A1 FROZEN / UNTOUCHED**

Frozen specification: `experiments/E002_CROSS_SCALE_PERSISTENCE.md`

Scope: `OBS-001`, `OBS-002`, and `OBS-003` only. `OBS-004` remains REFUTED and excluded.

Fresh fixed-width scale ladder:

- S1: `[2_000_000, 3_000_000)`;
- S2: `[4_000_000, 5_000_000)`;
- S3: `[8_000_000, 9_000_000)`;
- S4: `[16_000_000, 17_000_000)`;
- S5: `[32_000_000, 33_000_000)`.

All five bands are mutually disjoint and exclude E001 D0, H0, and historical reserved A0 = `[10_000_000, 11_000_000)`. A0 was untouched when E002 was frozen; FAIL-003 later contaminated it by internal generation without inspection.

Frozen persistence tests preserve the exact E001 definitions:

- OBS-001: third forward difference `0` must be the strict unique mode in every E002 band;
- OBS-002: width-2 gap motif `[6, 6]` must be the strict unique mode in every E002 band;
- OBS-003: directed reduced-residue transition support must be complete for every modulus in the unchanged family `{6,10,12,30,60}` in every E002 band.

A tie fails the applicable modal-rank criterion; any missing allowed transition fails OBS-003. Overall E002 persistence requires passing all five bands. The full predeclared ladder is evaluated even after an earlier failure; no replacement/additional bands or post-result thresholds are allowed.

Goal: test definition-preserving persistence with increasing value magnitude while holding the one-million band width fixed.

Promotion cap: no new observations or candidates in the E002 execution unit; it records persistence outcomes for the existing replicated observations only.

Execution result: valid implementation checkpoint `1d819af033b1869a144de6e840c72af0c13abea6` produced a byte-deterministic 10,107-byte criterion artifact, SHA-256 `32d24d5ea2417b1fdbf02b0787e6a616170162e0f7373dae32cf6906f19d37d5`. OBS-001 is **NOT PERSISTENT** because S1 and S3 fail the frozen strict unique-mode criterion. OBS-002 is **PERSISTENT** across S1-S5. OBS-003 is **PERSISTENT** across S1-S5 with complete support for every frozen modulus in every band. Historical E001 REPLICATED/REFUTED statuses are unchanged.

Protocol incident: the discarded first implementation constructed a whole-prefix prime list through 32,999,999 and therefore internally generated A0 before filtering. No A0 values or A0-derived criterion output were inspected, but under the literal exclusion rule A0 is contaminated and quarantined; see FAIL-003. The corrected valid E002 run used isolated segmented generation and did not traverse A0.

Protocol recovery (D1-05): exactly one replacement adversarial reserve is frozen: **A1 = `[33_000_000, 34_000_000)`**. Selection rule: preserve width 1,000,000 and choose the first million-aligned band whose lower endpoint lies strictly beyond every integer value previously generated by any recorded PRIMES prime-generation path. The maximum such value is 32,999,999 from FAIL-003, so the rule deterministically selects 33,000,000 as A1's lower endpoint. This depends only on generation provenance, not observed prime behaviour or E002 criterion values. A1 is disjoint from D0, H0, S1-S5, and A0; it has not been generated, inspected, or executed, and no prime-derived A1 result exists in `research/evidence/`. Recovery record: `experiments/E002_ADVERSARIAL_RESERVE_RECOVERY_2026-10-06.md`.

D1-06 candidate-synthesis result: no `CAND-###` was allocated. OBS-002 persists in all seven tested width-1,000,000 bands, but any statement beyond those bands needs an unsupported quantifier over untested locations, widths, later scales, or infinitely many ladder members. OBS-003 has complete support for all five frozen moduli in all seven tested bands, but a stronger statement needs an unsupported all-moduli, broader-family, all-band/eventual, or infinite-occurrence quantifier. A finite-grid statement would only restate the committed evidence. OBS-001 remains historically REPLICATED but E002 NOT PERSISTENT; OBS-004 remains REFUTED; A1 remains untouched.

Next bounded action: D1-07 / SQ-003 — design and freeze an event-centred neighbourhood preflight before any new prime-derived execution. Declare exact event definitions, thresholds, neighbourhood encodings, fresh discovery/holdout/adversarial ranges, promotion rules, and determinism requirements. Keep A1 untouched and outside SQ-003.

## SQ-003 — Event-centred neighbourhoods

Stage: discovery

Status: **PREFLIGHT COMPLETE — E003 FROZEN / NOT EXECUTED; D3 NEXT; H3/A3/A1 UNTOUCHED**

Frozen specification: `experiments/E003_EVENT_CENTRED_NEIGHBOURHOODS.md`

Fresh metadata-only partition:

- discovery D3: `[35_000_000, 36_000_000)`;
- untouched holdout H3: `[37_000_000, 38_000_000)`;
- adversarial A3: `[70_000_000, 71_000_000)`.

The selection rule uses only the frozen one-million width and A1's metadata. D3 starts at the first million-aligned lower endpoint strictly greater than A1's exclusive upper endpoint 34,000,000; H3 leaves one full-width guard band after D3; A3 starts at twice the D3 lower endpoint. FAIL-003 records generation only through 32,999,999, and A1=`[33_000_000,34_000_000)` remains ungenerated, so all three E003 targets are untouched under committed generation provenance. A1 is not an E003 target.

Frozen event classes:

- `prime_dense`: globally anchored width-1,000 occupancy block whose centre occupancy is strictly greater than the two neighbouring block occupancies on each side;
- `prime_sparse`: same, with the centre occupancy strictly lower than the two neighbouring occupancies on each side;
- `strict_in_band_record_gap`: an in-band prime gap, excluding the first, strictly larger than every earlier in-band gap. This is intentionally distinct from E001's historical strict global record-gap event.

Dense/sparse descriptive radius is 8 blocks; record-gap descriptive radius is 8 gaps. Dense/sparse promotion asymmetry uses only outer offsets 3 through 8 so the selection halo cannot itself become an observation. Exact raw words, centred residual words, integer asymmetry vectors, and sign signatures are the only neighbourhood object families.

Goal: search for repeated exact local configurations and before/after asymmetries under the frozen grammar.

Promotion cap: 5 observations. OBS eligibility requires at least 20 serializable events in the class, an exact target tuple that is the strict unique mode of one frozen object family, at least 3 target occurrences, and survival of explicit definitional/triviality exclusions. If more than five patterns qualify, the frozen deterministic ranking in the E003 specification selects the first five.

Any promoted D3 observation must freeze the exact same-target strict-unique-mode H3 criterion before H3 generation. A tie, fewer than 20 serializable H3 events, fewer than 3 target occurrences, or a higher-frequency competitor fails replication.

Generation guard: discovery execution may generate only low base support within `[0,100_000)` plus segmented D3. Whole-prefix generation above 100,000 is forbidden. The implementation must fail before generation if any requested interval can intersect A1, H3, A3, a guard band, or another non-target high range.

Next bounded action: D1-08 / SQ-003 — implement the frozen E003 evaluator and guard, validate semantics, execute D3 only twice for byte determinism, inspect only the allowlisted descriptive outputs, and promote at most five observations under the frozen grammar with H3 criteria frozen before any H3 generation.

## SQ-004 — Residue-transition factorization

Stage: discovery

Compare transition fingerprints across related moduli and ask whether one fingerprint can be exactly derived from another by a simple projection/refinement rule.

Goal: exact inter-modulus identities or forbidden transition patterns.

Promotion cap: 5 observations.

## SQ-005 — Historical rediscovery calibration

Stage: calibration

Run the method in the quarantined calibration lane described in docs/CALIBRATION_PROTOCOL.md.

Goal: learn which discovery operations are capable of producing genuinely explanatory objects.
